# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Using the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, we will evaluate three machine learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risk. 
First, we’ll use the oversampling RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and then we’ll use the undersampling ClusterCentroids algorithm.  Using these algorithms, we’ll resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.
